TODO [0.1]

    1) find a formula that will squash and work properly for `delta_values`
       have a look at energy functions and logistic functions

    2) Remove all threaded code from SemanticWordNet
    
    3) Fix SemanticWordNet: make it a `memory` class (which stores `delta_path`s)
                            remove all senses and reference to them
                            use as a `utility` class which searches delta_path intersections
                            for example, find common words between two graphs, and then establish relational metrics

TEST [0.1]

    1) test graph (alone) - add unit tests for graph
    2) test path_finder & delta_path (ASAP)
    3) finally, test the SemanticWordNet (or wtv you rename it to)
